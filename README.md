This spagetti was made sole-ly by Mr. spagetti expert

the reason why its in procedural approach is because its a procedure followed one step by another and not

# For linux
install "freeglut3-dev" or "freeglut-devel" and to make a application on the command line us these linker options:
- -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm

here lm is required for linking libm (math library?)

# For Windows
idk, google it
